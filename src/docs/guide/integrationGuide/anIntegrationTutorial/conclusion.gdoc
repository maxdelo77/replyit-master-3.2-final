This document provided a hands on guide to using *j*Billing's integration services. While
the Client API provides much more service calls and features than what was covered
here, we hope this tutorial has provided some useful insight into how to put the
integration API to good use in your programs.
The sections that follow cover all service calls and data structures provided by the Client
API in more depth, and explain what parameters they require and what information you
get in return, where applicable. Please refer to these sections for further details.
The *j*Billing integration layer provides a rich set of features that allow your application to
seamlessly integrate the billing process into your business logic. The Client API provides
a flexible and intuitive layer of abstraction that further simplifies the integration process
and makes your application independent of the specific technology that takes care of
communicating with the *j*Billing server. The Client API is easily available to any Java
application.
The SOAP layer provides further support for non-Java applications that nevertheless
need to integrate with *j*Billing. Most modern web programming frameworks provide
support for SOAP services, which greatly expands the set of programming languages
and production environments that *j*Billing can integrate with.
