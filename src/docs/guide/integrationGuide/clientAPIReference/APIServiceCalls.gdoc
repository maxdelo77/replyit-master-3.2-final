The Service APIs/Calls are grouped according to functional area or data entities in jBilling, for example: 
User Management APIs, Orders, Items, etc. All data contained in the Client API data structures can be accessed by means 
of the _getter_ and _setter_ methods of each property (i.e., @getFaxNumber()@ and @setFaxNumber()@ provide access to the _faxNumber_ property). 
When describing data structures, this guide always provides the property name. This reference is equally useful for those 
planning to use the web services directly, or for those that will be using the jBilling Client API. For non-Java languages, the data 
structures will look slightly different: they are described in the WSDL descriptor and how that is translated to each language varies. 
For those using the jBilling Client API from a Java application, the data structures can be used directly as classes.

{note}
For a finer coverage of the SOAP support, refer to the WSDL file or use a SOAP
introspection tool (such as SoapUI). All the SOAP methods, however, share the same
name, parameters and functionality as their API counterparts.

All service calls provided by the API are covered in the Web Services API Reference docs.

Please refer to the client/Web Services API from here: [API Reference|Web Services].
