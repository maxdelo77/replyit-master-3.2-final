This section discusses the approaches available for integrating *j*Billing in your
application. While *j*Billing exposes a unique Web Services integration API, there are
other ways of interacting with that layer too, based on the technology available to the
application developer in the target system. 

Therefore, if your application is written in Java or at has a way of interfacing with Java,
then the simplest way of integrating *j*Billing with your application is by making use of the +jBilling
Client API+. The +jBilling client API+ is a pure Java API that another Java program can directly call/use.

Service calls can also be performed by means of plain SOAP or Hessian/Burlap calls. This type 
of interaction is useful for those situations in which you cannot use Java as your programming 
language (either because your server does not support it or because your application has already 
been written in another programming language). 

Generally, it easier to use the *j*Billing API than hard-coding SOAP or Hessian/Burlap calls directly.

We'll now examine the above possibilities and also see some sample code for each instance.
