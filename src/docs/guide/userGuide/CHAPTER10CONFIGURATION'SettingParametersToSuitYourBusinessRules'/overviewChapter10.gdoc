One of *j*Billing's greatest features is that it allows you to manipulate, or configure different areas of the system, in order to accommodate your businesses requirements and needs.

If your company requires a particular currency, you have the ability to add it, or select it from a list. You can set up many different types of notifications, and have them automatically sent to your customers. You can also add custom fields to your customer contact screen, such as alternate phone numbers or addresses. 
The aspects described above are just a small sample of the different functionality you can manipulate in this section of the system. By the end of this chapter, you will have a better understanding of what kind of configuration is available within *j*Billing.
