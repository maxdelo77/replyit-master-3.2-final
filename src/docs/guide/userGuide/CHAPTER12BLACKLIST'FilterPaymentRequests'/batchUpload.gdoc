The batch upload feature allows externally generated comma-separated values (CSV) blacklist files to be uploaded through the GUI. It can either add to or replace existing uploaded blacklist entries.

It will not modify blacklist entries that were created by the add/remove link or because customers have had their status become 'suspended' or higher. To get to the Batch Upload screen, click on Configuration, then Blacklist.
