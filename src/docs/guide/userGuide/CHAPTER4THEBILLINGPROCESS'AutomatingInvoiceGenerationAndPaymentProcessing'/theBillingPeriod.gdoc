The billing period is: *the single most important parameter to configure.* It will determine how often the billing process runs, and therefore, how often invoices are generated. A monthly billing period will run once per month, a weekly one, once per week and so on. This seems quite simple, but has a very important result: *it's the amount of time the process will 'see' into the future.*

The billing process looks into a specific period of time for purchase orders that should produce an invoice. If the process runs on January 1st and the period is set for one month, then the process will generate invoices for any purchase order that has billable time falling on any day of January (1st to the 31st). To understand what billable time is, let's take a closer look into the way the billing process selects a purchase order to create a new invoice.
