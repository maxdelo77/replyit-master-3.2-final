Since invoices can only be created based purchase orders, they need to be created first. Once you have purchase orders, the invoice can be generated in two ways:

# The billing process generates an invoice automatically (please refer to Chapter 4: The Billing Process for more information).
# An invoice is created manually (please refer to Chapter 3: Purchase Orders for more information).
