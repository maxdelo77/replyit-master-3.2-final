The system will, by default, apply the number 1 to your first generated invoice. If, however, your company has generated previous invoices from a legacy system, it is necessary to tell the system what number the first invoice it generates for you should be.

Invoices will be generated using the number that you provide. The system will increment this number by one for every new invoice. You also have the option of adding a prefix to your invoice numbering. This prefix can have up to 20 characters and can be any digit, letter or symbol. 

To configure the number of your first invoice, and perhaps the prefix to your invoices, click on Configuration, then Invoice Display. You can update the invoice numbering at any time.
